# Madlibs
# A Mad Libs is a word game where one player prompts others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading the paragraph.

# Create a story in HTML with a missing noun, verb, adjective.
# The story should not be visible until the values are submitted.
# Create a input field for each missing word.
# Use an event listener to add the input values into the story.
